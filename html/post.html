        <p class="post-intro">When you're debating someone, you want to use all the resources at your disposal to convince them you're right. And that's great – but you should be careful that you don't end up using a logical fallacy to help you make your point.</p>
        
        <h2>What is a Logical Fallacy?</h2>
        
        <p>A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning that makes your argument less effective and convincing. And you want to be able to spot these fallacies in other people's arguments (and your own) so you can call them out or fix your own strategy.</p>
        
        <p>There are two major types of <em class="keyword">logical fallacies</em>, formal and informal.</p>
        
        <p><u>In formal fallacies</u>, there's a problem with <strong>how</strong> you structure your argument, and how you're making your points. You might be speaking the truth, but the <em class="keyword">logic</em> breaks down because of the way you're putting your arguments together.</p>

        <p><u>In informal fallacies</u>, there's a problem with <strong>what</strong> you're saying, and the information might be incorrect or misleading.</p>

        <p>In this article, we'll focus on these informal fallacies as they can be pretty common in everyday debate. And keep in mind that we're not talking about the effectiveness or persuasiveness of your argument, here – after all, fallacious arguments can be very persuasive.</p>

        <p>Instead, it's all about giving you the tools to identify these weak arguments so you don't make these mistakes in your reasoning.</p>

        <h2>List of Logical Fallacies with Examples</h2>

        <p>In this article, we'll look at the most common informal fallacies so you can learn to identify them and avoid them.</p>

        <h3>The Sunk Cost Fallacy</h3>
        
        
        <p>Have you ever finished a task (that you really didn't want to complete) simply because you'd put so much time and effort in already? You probably felt like you didn't want all that hard work to go to waste, or to be for nothing.</p>

        <p>You were likely falling prey to the sunk cost fallacy. It states that it's actually better to abandon a project that's going nowhere (at any point) rather than waste any more time, energy, and resources trying to finish it for the sole purpose of finishing it.</p>

        <p>The reason for this might seem counterintuitive, but think about it: rather than spend another minute of your precious time doing something that isn't going anywhere, it's better to switch gears ASAP (before you spend any more time) and start putting your energy into something productive.</p>

        <h4>Example of a Sunk Cost Fallacy</h4>

        <p>Let's say that you've decided to write a book. You spend hours and hours doing research, making an outline, and writing the first 10 chapters. You've put months if not years of your life into writing this book.</p>

        <p>But then perhaps your interests change, or you no longer wish to be an author. You might think you should finish the book because you're so close or because you've already spent so much time and energy on it.</p>

        <p>Instead, though, you should leave that project behind and focus on what's ahead. Maybe you're trying to get a new job, or learn a new skill, or move to a new city. Any of these current and relevant initiatives would suffer if you continued to work on your unsuccessful book project.</p>

        <p>So how do you distinguish between this sunk cost fallacy and persevering until you finish something difficult? Well, it helps to think about whether the experience will benefit you in the long run – in which case, it would be helpful to see it through.</p>

        <p>For example, let's say you've done three years of a four year degree program at a college or university. But your interests have changed, and you want to pursue something that doesn't require that degree.</p>

        <p>Still, it might make sense to finish the program, as a college degree typically only helps you in future career moves – not to mention the life experience you'll gain in the process.</p>

        <h3>The Ad Hominem Fallacy</h3>

        <p>Ad hominem means "against the person" in Latin. So the ad hominem fallacy happens when you attack a person's character, appearance, personality, or other irrelevant aspects in an argument instead of attacking what they're saying.</p>
        
        <p>These types of attacks are fallacious because they're not relevant to the argument, and so they distract from the point at hand. It doesn't really matter if you think your mom is being a jerk – she's still right that you shouldn't speed while driving.</p>

        <h4>Example of an Ad Hominem Fallacy</h4>

        <p>Many people associate ad hominem fallacies with political debates. Unfortunately, some candidates don't seem to be able to help themselves.</p>

        <p>What if Candidate A said that you shouldn't trust Candidate B because Candidate B doesn't dress well? There's no established link (that I know of!) connecting a "good dresser" with trustworthiness or good political decision-making, so this would be an ad hominem fallacy.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning that makes your argument less effective and convincing. And you want to be able to spot these fallacies in other people's arguments (and your own) so you can call them out or fix your own strategy.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or what about when Candidate A insults Candidate B for being too nerdy, or not cool enough? These qualities, first of all, are subjective, and second, they shouldn't affect Candidate B's ability to govern effectively.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, sometimes people just deliver insults that aren't actually logical fallacies because they aren't part of the argument. For example, if you were to say that all New Yorkers are rude and unfriendly (but you aren't trying to make a point), that's just an (untrue) insult and not a fallacy.</p>

        <p>So when you're debating someone, leave their personal characteristics out of it unless they're relevant to your point.</p>
